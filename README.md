## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See the game's rules at first instance and during the game without it affecting the player's progress
-   See 2 players take turns in playing
-   A round is finished after the 2 players have rolled the die
-   Generate a random dice number between 1 and 6 with the roll die button
-   The random number number is added to players' scores
-   A double or nothing button is shown after the first round
-   With the double or nothing button, players can take a risk to either double their score or leave it the same
-   The winner is announced after a round is completed and when a player has a score of 20 and above
-   Players can reset a game after a winner is announced
